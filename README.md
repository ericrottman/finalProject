# finalProject
For your class project we will be creating an application to interact with a webservice in order to obtain data. Your program will use all of the information you’ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.

Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from openweathermap.org.  Your program must display the weather information in an READABLE format to the user.

Requirements: 

Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from: http://openweathermap.org/
Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.
Use functions including a main function.
Allow the user to run the program multiple times.
Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user.
Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
Use Python 3.
Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.
Deliverables (More detail on these deliverables is provided in the the weeks they are due): 

Flowchart (Due week 3)
Draft Program in a .py file (Due week 7)
Final Program in a .py file (Due week 9)
Project Notes:

Sign up for API Key http://openweathermap.org/appid
The API key will look something similar to this: d5751b1a9e2e4b2b8c7983646072da8b
Make a connection to the API using the Requests library.
